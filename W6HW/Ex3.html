<p><sub> Globalization of trade, the emergence of information economies, and the growth of the Internet and other global communications networks have recast the role of information systems in business and management. This course provides not only an introduction to management information systems, but also the organization and technology in a networked enterprise. It also covers some basic knowledge of management information systems - what they are, how they affect the organization and its employees, and how they can make business more competitive and efficient. Information systems have become essential for creating competitive firms, managing global corporations, and providing useful products and services to customers. </sub></p>
